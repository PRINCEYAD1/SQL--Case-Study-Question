# üßë‚Äçüíº HR Data Analysis using SQL

## üìå Overview

This project provides a structured analysis of an **HR database** using **SQL**. It covers multiple **real-world business scenarios** such as employee insights, departmental analysis, job roles, hiring patterns, and more.

The goal is to showcase **SQL querying skills** and solve business-relevant problems using **joins, filtering, aggregation, subqueries, and date functions**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

* Analyze employees based on salary, department, and hiring trends.
* Perform joins across HR tables to derive meaningful business insights.
* Explore job and department data to help with HR planning and decision-making.
* Use date-based queries to track employee hiring patterns.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

This project uses the following standard HR schema tables:

* `employees`
* `departments`
* `jobs`
* `locations`
* `countries`
* `regions`
* `dependents`

> **Note**: Data is assumed to be stored in a MySQL-compatible RDBMS.

## üß† Business Problems and SQL Solutions

### 1. ‚úÖ Show all records from all tables

```sql
SELECT * FROM countries;
SELECT * FROM departments;
SELECT * FROM dependents;
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM jobs;
SELECT * FROM locations;
SELECT * FROM regions;
```

---

### 2. ü•à Find the Second Highest Salary

SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```

---

### 3. üè¢ Employees in Department 9 with Salary > 10,000

```sql
SELECT department_id, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS fullname, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 9 AND salary > 10000;
```

---

### 4. üë®‚Äçüíº Departments where Manager's Name is Michael

```sql
SELECT department_id, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS manager_name

```

---

### 5. üíº Jobs where Min Salary is Less than Salary of Employee 105

);
```

---

### 6. üîÅ Employee & Manager Pairing

FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

---

### 7. üìÖ Employees Joined Each Year in Departments 5 or 9

```sql
SELECT 
  YEAR(hire_date) AS year_joined,
  COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (5, 9)
GROUP BY YEAR(hire_date);
```

---

### 8. üí∞ Job ID, Department ID, and Total Salary Grouped

```sql
SELECT job_id, department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY job_id, department_id;
```

---

### 9. üìå Employee Name and Job Title Where Salary is Between Job's Min and Max Salary

```sql
SELECT 
  CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS employee_name,
  j.job_title,
  e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id
WHERE e.salary BETWEEN j.min_salary AND j.max_salary;
```

---

### 10. üìÜ Employees Hired on June 17

```sql
SELECT first_name, job_title, department_name, hire_date
FROM employees e
JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%m-%d') = '06-17';
```

---

### 11. üÖ∞Ô∏è Employees Whose First or Last Name Starts with 'S'

FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'S%' OR last_name LIKE 'S%';
```

---

### 12. üéâ Employees Hired in May

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS employee, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE MONTH(hire_date) = 5;
```

---

### 13. üí∏ First Salary Date (Assuming End of Hiring Month)

```sql
SELECT first_name, LAST_DAY(hire_date) AS first_salary_date
FROM employees;
```

---

### 14. üìÖ Employees Hired in 1997

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE YEAR(hire_date) = 1997;
```

---

### 15. üî† First Word of Job Titles

```sql
SELECT job_title, SUBSTRING_INDEX(job_title, ' ', 1) AS first_word
FROM jobs;
```

---

## üîó Join-Based Queries

### 1. Show Full Name, Department Number, and Name

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS fullname,
       d.department_id, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

---

### 2. Employees in Department 40 or 80

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS fullname,
       d.department_id, d.department_name

WHERE d.department_id IN (40, 80);
```

---
